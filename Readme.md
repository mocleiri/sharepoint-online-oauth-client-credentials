# Sharepoint Online OAuth Client Credentials

Instructions on how to acquire the client credentials to authenticate and perform REST API operations

While just a proof of concept, it does work and pull requests to add additional out of the box API are welcomed.

Please start with acquiring [Credentials](docs/Credentials.md) and then [Setup](docs/Setup.md) the unit test to use them.
